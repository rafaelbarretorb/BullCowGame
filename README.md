(under development!!)

# Welcome to Bulls & Cows Game!

This game is my version of the code provided by the Udemy's Online Course "Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games". My personal goal is design a simple game in pure C++ before pass into the Unreal Engine environment.

## Concept and Rules
* This is a "guess the isogram" game.
* An isogram is a word with no repeating letters.
* The user has a limited number

## Requirements
* Plain text instructions for all interactions
* Code to deal help the player make a valid guess
	* string with only English characters and letters
	* all lowercase
	* an isogram
	* right length
* Code the check the number of Bulls and Cows in the guess,  compared the hidden word
* Code to Keep track of the number of valid guesses
* Inputs
	* Number of letters
* Outputs
	* The status of the inputs
	* The result of the guessing
	* if the number of letters inserted was corrected
	* if the player would like to play again
	* 
## Future Ideas
* Give feedback on every key press
* Have a large dictionary of hidden words
* User selectable word length and diffciulty
